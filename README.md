# A Multi-step Minimax Q-learning Algorithm

This repository contains the code for the new two-step algorithm proposed for solving two-player zero-sum stochastic games. This repository can be utilized to reproduce the results provided in the paper titled "A Multi-step Minimax Q-learning algorithm for two-player zero-sum Markov games."

Requirements: nashpy package
